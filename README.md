dvdRentalApp:

All I am using this app for is to demonstrate to myself that I can learn
Postgresql while at the same time relearning old topics that I have 
already taught myself.

These topics include:
1. Creating a new git repository and linking it to a directory that 
   I have initialized
2. Creating a heroku app along with all of it's little querks including:
	a. creating a package.json file
	b. "npm install"ing express along with any other packages that
	   I might be using with said heroku app
	c. Using the terminal effectively while not making any typing 
	   errors and navigating with cd/cd .. effectively and efficiently

Hahaha, I am laughing at what I just wrote above because it sounds a 
bit ridiculous but I want to make sure I have some sort of text that 
people can read when they open up this repository. I think when I look
back to this in the future I'll have a good laugh or two at it.. I mean,
that's what coding is all about right? Not laughing, but having fun and 
learning in the process. That's what life is all about!
